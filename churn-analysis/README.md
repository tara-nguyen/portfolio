## Abstract

The aim of this project was to predict clients’ churning behavior – specifically, to find out factors that predict whether or not a client at a company will eventually stop using its services. This type of problem is important in business because companies want to identify clients who are likely to churn in the future, so the company can figure out how to keep them, for example, by making them special offers. For this project, I ran a few classification models and tried to select the one that best would best identify clients who churn.
