## Abstract

**Background**: *Competitive balance*, which refers to the degree of uncertainty regarding the outcome of a competition, is frequently debated among soccer fans and has received considerable attention both [in](References) and [outside](https://www.thestatszone.com/archive/how-competitive-are-the-top-five-european-leagues-13538) academia.

**Data and research question**: In this project I analyzed team performances (points per game, win proportions, etc.) in the four soccer leagues from the 2015/2016 season to the 2019/2020 season. The main research question was: **_Which soccer league is the most competitive?_**

**Method and findings**: The project was completed in R (except for part of the data cleaning process that was done in Excel). Through exploratory data analysis and k-means clustering, I found that, in general, the Major League Soccer was the more competitive than the Bundesliga, the La Liga, and the Premier League.
