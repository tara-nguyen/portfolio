## Introduction

It has been more than a month since Americans aged 16 and above received the first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Pfizer for short), one of the two COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States. The other vaccine, named Moderna, was authorized four days later (on December 18th) for use on people aged 18 and above. The Department of Health and Human Services published two datasets, one for each vaccine, of the numbers of doses allocated each week to different states and jurisdictions. Letâ€™s have a quick look at these numbers by visualizing them in a series of two graphs and four maps.
