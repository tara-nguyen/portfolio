## Assignment prompt

A small, private housing organization is looking to expand on opportunities in new neighborhoods. Although the organization cannot disclose much about their project, they would still like an outside opinion on housing market patterns in certain neighborhoods.

The organization has hired you as a consultant to analyze a subset of their data and provide recommendations for areas of potential growth. The organization has a mix of people with varying data science backgrounds. The ones who will be reading your report range from somewhat familiar with data science to completely unfamiliar with data science.

Generate a data report and summary of the given dataset. Be sure to explicitly address the following items in your report:
1. Data summary, oddities, and outliers

    a. What are all of the oddities and outliers in the dataset?
    
    b. How do you know?
    
    c. How do you plan to address oddities and outliers?
    
2. Data cleaning

    a. What did you change/remove from the original dataset? Why?

    b. Did you perform any merges?
    
3. One-variable visuals

    a. There are multiple variables to work with and multiple visuals you can use. Pick out some interesting ones to highlight and talk about. Be sure to clearly describe your observation that that someone can follow even without seeing the graph.

    b. Include at least one histogram

    c. Include at least one bar plot (of a different variable from the histogram)

    d. Include at least one box plot (of a different variable from the bar plot and histogram)

4. Two-variable visuals

    a. There are multiple variables to work with and multiple visuals you can use. Pick out some interesting ones to highlight and talk about. Be sure to clearly describe
your observation that that someone can follow even without seeing the graph.

    b. Include at least one scatter plot

    c. Include at least one high density plot

5. Analysis

    a. The organization did not provide you with any specific topic to investigate. They are interested in what patterns you find. What are some interesting findings?

    b. Include at least one regression result

    c. Include at least one clustering result

6. Sensitivity analysis

    a. The dataset has some missing data. Re-run your entire analysis filling in the missing data using a different method than your original approach (from 1 and 2). For example, if you used listwise deletion, try single imputation or multiple imputation. Do not use pairwise deletion.

    b. What method did you use to fill in the missing data this time around?

    c. Compare and contrast your results from your original run of the analysis.
